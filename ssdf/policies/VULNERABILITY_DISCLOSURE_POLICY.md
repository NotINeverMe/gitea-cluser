## 4. SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION

### 4.1 CVSS v3.1 Scoring

We use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1 to assess severity:

**Severity Levels:**

| Severity | CVSS Score | Impact Examples |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **CRITICAL** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Remote code execution (RCE), authentication bypass with full system access, complete data breach |
| **HIGH** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Privilege escalation to admin, SQL injection with data access, significant data leakage |
| **MEDIUM** | 4.0 - 6.9 | Cross-site scripting (XSS), CSRF, limited information disclosure |
| **LOW** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Minor information disclosure, non-exploitable misconfigurations, denial of service (low impact) |

### 4.2 Severity Assessment Criteria

**CRITICAL (CVSS 9.0-10.0):**
- **Attack Vector:** Network (remotely exploitable)
- **Attack Complexity:** Low (no special conditions)
- **Privileges Required:** None (no authentication)
- **User Interaction:** None (fully automated)
- **Impact:** High (Complete confidentiality/integrity/availability loss)

**Example:** Unauthenticated remote code execution on public-facing API

**HIGH (CVSS 7.0-8.9):**
- **Attack Vector:** Network or adjacent
- **Attack Complexity:** Low to medium
- **Privileges Required:** Low (basic user account)
- **Impact:** High on at least one CIA triad element

**Example:** Authenticated SQL injection allowing access to all customer data

**MEDIUM (CVSS 4.0-6.9):**
- **Attack Vector:** Network or local
- **Privileges Required:** Low to high
- **User Interaction:** Required (user must take action)
- **Impact:** Partial (limited data exposure or functionality impact)

**Example:** Stored XSS requiring admin to visit malicious page

**LOW (CVSS 0.1-3.9):**
- **Attack Complexity:** High (requires specific conditions)
- **Impact:** Low (minimal effect on operations or data)

**Example:** Information disclosure of non-sensitive system metadata

### 4.3 Special Considerations

**Aggravating Factors (increase severity):**
- Vulnerability in authentication or authorization mechanisms
- Exposure of CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information)
- Impact on cryptographic controls
- Easily exploitable with public exploit code available
- Affects widely deployed component

**Mitigating Factors (decrease severity):**
- Requires physical access
- Requires compromised privileged account
- Limited to test/staging environments (not production)
- Theoretical vulnerability with no practical exploit path
- Protected by defense-in-depth controls

4. **Contributing factors:** Why existing controls didn't catch it
5. **Remediation:** Immediate fix and long-term prevention
6. **Lessons learned:** Process improvements

**RCA Documentation:** Stored in `/compliance/evidence/ssdf/RV.2.1/root-cause-analysis/`

---

## 6. REMEDIATION AND PATCHING

### 6.1 Remediation Strategies

**Immediate Mitigation (within hours):**
- WAF rule to block exploit attempts
- Temporary service disable (if CRITICAL and no other option)
- Access control changes (restrict affected endpoints)
- Monitoring increase (detect exploitation attempts)

**Short-Term Fix (within SLA):**
- Code patch addressing vulnerability
- Configuration change
- Component version upgrade (if third-party)

**Long-Term Prevention:**
- Architectural changes to prevent class of vulnerabilities
- Additional security controls (input validation, output encoding)
- Enhanced testing (new test cases, fuzz testing)

### 6.2 Patch Development and Testing

**Development Process:**
1. **Reproduce vulnerability** in development environment
2. **Develop fix** with security review
3. **Code review** by Security Champion
4. **Unit tests** covering vulnerability and fix
5. **Security testing** (verify fix, no regression)
6. **Staging deployment** and validation
7. **Production deployment** (hotfix or next release)

**Quality Gates:**
- Fix must pass all existing security gates (SAST, SCA, container scan)
- New test case added to prevent regression
- Security Champion approval required

### 6.3 Hotfix vs. Regular Release

**Hotfix Deployment (expedited):**
- **Trigger:** CRITICAL or HIGH severity vulnerabilities being actively exploited
- **Process:** Bypass normal release cycle, emergency change control
- **Timeline:** Within SLA (24-72 hours)
- **Testing:** Abbreviated (focused on fix, critical paths)
- **Approval:** CISO + Release Manager

**Regular Release Deployment:**
- **Trigger:** MEDIUM or LOW severity, or proactive security improvements
- **Process:** Normal release cycle (weekly/bi-weekly)
- **Timeline:** Next scheduled release
- **Testing:** Full regression testing
- **Approval:** Standard release approval

### 6.4 Deployment Verification

**Post-Deployment Checks:**
1. **Vulnerability scanner re-scan:** Confirm vulnerability no longer detected
2. **Manual verification:** Reproduce original steps, verify fix
3. **Smoke tests:** Ensure no functional regression
4. **Monitoring review:** Check for anomalies or errors
5. **Reporter confirmation:** Request reporter to verify fix (if possible)

**Rollback Plan:**
- Prepared for all hotfix deployments
- Automated rollback trigger on critical errors
- Manual rollback decision within 30 minutes

---

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SUMMARY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the User
Management API (versions 1.0.0 - 1.2.3) that could allow an
authenticated user to execute arbitrary SQL commands and access
sensitive data.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AFFECTED PRODUCTS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Product: DevSecOps Platform API
Affected Versions: 1.0.0 - 1.2.3
Fixed Version: 1.2.4

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CVSS v3.1 SCORE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Base Score: 8.6 (HIGH)
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

Breakdown:
- Attack Vector: Network (remotely exploitable)
- Attack Complexity: Low
- Privileges Required: Low (authenticated user)
- User Interaction: None
- Confidentiality Impact: High
- Integrity Impact: High
- Availability Impact: Low

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VULNERABILITY DETAILS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The User Management API endpoint /api/v1/users/search accepts a
"filter" parameter that is insufficiently sanitized before being
used in a SQL query. An authenticated attacker can inject SQL
commands via this parameter.

Example vulnerable request:
  POST /api/v1/users/search
  {"filter": "'; DROP TABLE users; --"}

Impact:
- Unauthorized data access (read all user records)
- Data modification or deletion
- Potential privilege escalation

No evidence of exploitation in production systems.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- Outdated software versions with no known vulnerabilities

### 10.2 Response for Out-of-Scope Reports

**Our Response:**
- We will acknowledge receipt and explain why it's out of scope
- We may still fix the issue as part of general hardening
- No formal tracking ID or SLA commitment
- No public credit (but we appreciate the report)

**Example Response:**
```
Thank you for your report about missing security headers on our website.

While we appreciate you bringing this to our attention, missing security
headers without a demonstrated exploit path are not considered vulnerabilities
under our disclosure policy. However, we will review this as part of our
ongoing security improvements.

We encourage you to continue responsibly reporting security issues. Please
refer to our disclosure policy for in-scope items.

Best regards,
Security Team
```
