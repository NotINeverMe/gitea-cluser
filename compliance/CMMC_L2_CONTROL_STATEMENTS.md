## DOMAIN 1: ACCESS CONTROL (AC)

### AC.L2-3.1.1 - Limit system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, and devices (including other systems)

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization limits system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, or devices (including other systems).

**Implementation Statement**:

The Gitea DevSecOps Platform restricts access to authorized users through a multi-layered access control architecture:

**User Access Controls**:
- All users must authenticate through Gitea's built-in authentication system or OAuth2 integration with enterprise Identity Provider
- User accounts are provisioned only after formal access request and manager approval documented in JIRA
- Default access is deny-all; permissions are explicitly granted based on role
- User accounts are uniquely identified by email address (no shared accounts)

**Process Controls**:
- Service accounts are used for automated processes with least-privilege IAM policies
- API access requires authenticated tokens bound to specific user/service account identities
- CI/CD pipeline processes execute under dedicated service accounts with job-specific permissions

**Device Controls**:
- GCP Workload Identity binds Kubernetes service accounts to GCP IAM identities
- Device trust via GCP BeyondCorp for user endpoints
- mTLS certificate authentication for service-to-service communication

**Technical Implementation**:
- Gitea RBAC: Organization owners, repository admins, developers, read-only users
- GCP IAM: Custom roles with minimal permission sets (storage.objects.create vs. broad Storage Admin)
- OAuth2 integration enforces SSO with MFA requirement
- Session timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity
- Concurrent session limits: 3 active sessions per user

**Evidence**:
- User account inventory (daily export via Gitea API)
- IAM policy configurations (weekly terraform state snapshot)
- Access request approval records (JIRA tickets)
- Authentication logs (Cloud Logging, 3-year retention)
- Session management logs

**Inheritance**: GCP IAM provides FedRAMP-authorized identity and access management (FedRAMP High boundary).

**Testing**: Quarterly access review; Attempt unauthorized access (verify denial); Verify session timeout enforcement.

### AC.L2-3.1.2 - Limit system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization limits system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute.

**Implementation Statement**:

Functional access restrictions are enforced through role-based permissions and policy-as-code enforcement:

**Transaction Restrictions**:
- **Developers**: Can create branches, open pull requests, view pipeline logs; CANNOT merge to main, modify protected branches, or approve own PRs
- **Reviewers**: Can approve pull requests, comment on code; CANNOT bypass security gates or override policy violations
- **Release Managers**: Can merge to protected branches, deploy to production; CANNOT modify security policies or IAM configurations
- **Security Team**: Can view all repositories, audit logs, security scan results; CANNOT directly commit code without review
- **Administrators**: Can modify system configurations, user permissions; ALL actions logged and require second-person approval for sensitive changes

**Function Enforcement Mechanisms**:
1. **Gitea Branch Protection**: Main branch requires 2 approvals, dismisses stale reviews, enforces code owner approval
2. **Terraform Sentinel**: Infrastructure changes violating cost limits (>$1000/month delta) require VP approval
3. **Atlantis Workflows**: `terraform apply` requires successful plan + security scan + explicit approval comment
4. **Security Gate Failures**: Pipeline automatically blocks promotion if SAST/container scan finds CRITICAL vulnerabilities

**Policy-as-Code Example**:
```sentinel
# Prevent non-security team from modifying KMS keys
import "tfplan/v2" as tfplan

main = rule {
  all tfplan.resource_changes as _, rc {
    rc.type is "google_kms_crypto_key" implies
      request.requester in approved_security_team
  }
}
```

**Evidence**:
- Branch protection configurations (exported from Gitea API)
- Sentinel policy enforcement logs (Atlantis audit trail)
- Role-based access matrix (documented in SSP)
- Denied action logs (failed permission checks in Cloud Logging)

**Testing**: Attempt developer direct push to main (verify blocked); Attempt non-approved infrastructure change (verify Sentinel denial); Verify code owner approval requirement.

### AC.L2-3.1.3 - Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization controls the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations.

**Implementation Statement**:

CUI data flow is controlled through network segmentation, encryption, data labeling, and access policies:

**CUI Identification**:
- Repositories containing CUI are tagged with `data_classification: cui` label in Git metadata
- GCS buckets storing CUI have `data_classification=cui` label and restricted IAM policies
- All CUI resources are within VPC Service Controls perimeter

**Flow Controls**:
1. **Ingress Controls**:
   - CUI data may only enter system through authenticated Gitea web UI or API with MFA
   - File upload size limits (100 MB) prevent bulk unauthorized data ingress
   - Pre-commit hooks scan for sensitive data patterns (SSN, credit cards) and reject commits

2. **Storage Controls**:
   - CUI at rest encrypted with CMEK (customer-managed keys in Cloud KMS)
   - Retention policies prevent premature deletion (7-year minimum for compliance records)
   - Bucket-level uniform access (no legacy ACLs)

3. **Transit Controls**:
   - TLS 1.3 mandatory for all web/API access
   - mTLS for service-to-service communication
   - VPN required for remote developer access to CUI repositories

4. **Egress Controls**:
   - Data Loss Prevention (DLP) scans prevent accidental CUI exposure in public repositories
   - Outbound VPC firewall rules restrict data exfiltration
   - GCS bucket export requires explicit IAM permission (rare grant)

5. **Processing Controls**:
   - CI/CD pipeline processing CUI runs in isolated workload identity
   - Temporary files sanitized after pipeline completion
   - Build artifacts containing CUI stored only in access-controlled registries

**Network Segmentation**:
- CUI Zone (VPC subnet 10.10.10.0/24): Isolated, requires bastion access
- Build Zone (VPC subnet 10.10.20.0/24): No direct CUI access
- Compliance Zone (VPC subnet 10.10.30.0/24): Evidence storage, highly restricted

**Evidence**:
- VPC flow logs (filtered for CUI resource access patterns)
- TLS handshake logs (verify TLS 1.3 enforcement)
- KMS key usage logs (encryption operations)
- DLP scan results (prevent CUI leakage)
- Data transfer audit logs

**Inheritance**: GCP VPC Service Controls (FedRAMP High) provides perimeter protection; Cloud KMS (FedRAMP High) provides key management.

**Testing**: Verify TLS 1.3 enforcement; Attempt CUI access from outside VPC-SC perimeter (verify denial); Validate encryption at rest; Test DLP detection.

### AC.L2-3.1.4 - Separate the duties of individuals to reduce the risk of malevolent activity

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization separates the duties of individuals to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.

**Implementation Statement**:

Separation of duties is enforced through role segregation and mandatory multi-person approval for sensitive operations:

**Segregated Roles**:
1. **Code Authors** ≠ **Code Reviewers**: Developers cannot approve own pull requests; minimum 2 reviewers required from different teams
2. **Infrastructure Operators** ≠ **Security Approvers**: Atlantis requires security team approval for changes to IAM, KMS, VPC-SC
3. **Security Scanners** ≠ **Vulnerability Exception Approvers**: Developers identify vulnerabilities; Security Lead approves exceptions
4. **Backup Operators** ≠ **Restore Operators**: Different IAM roles for backup creation vs. restore operations
5. **Audit Log Viewers** ≠ **Audit Log Deleters**: Compliance team (read-only) ≠ System admins (cannot delete logs due to retention lock)

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
- Gitea: `dismiss_stale_approvals: true` prevents approver from merging if new commits added
- Atlantis: Separate `plan` and `apply` permissions; apply requires explicit approval comment
- JIRA: Incident tickets require Security Team review before closure
- GCP IAM: Separation enforced via mutually exclusive custom roles

**Critical Operations Requiring Dual Control**:
- Production deployment: Developer initiates + Release Manager approves
- KMS key deletion: Security Lead proposes + CTO approves
- User permission elevation: Manager requests + Security Team approves
- Audit log export: Auditor requests + Compliance Officer approves

**Evidence**:
- RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) documented in SSP
- Pull request approval history (shows multiple reviewers)
- Atlantis approval logs (plan vs. apply separation)
- Privileged operation dual-approval records (JIRA tickets)

**Testing**: Attempt self-approval of PR (verify blocked); Verify infrastructure change requires security approval; Validate no single user can both create and delete backups.

---

### AC.L2-3.1.5 - Employ the principle of least privilege, including specific security functions

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization employs the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions and privileged accounts.

**Implementation Statement**:

Least privilege is systematically enforced through granular IAM policies, custom roles, and regular access reviews:

**Implementation Approach**:
1. **Default Deny**: All GCP resources default to no access; permissions explicitly granted
2. **Custom IAM Roles**: Pre-defined roles (e.g., Editor, Owner) are NOT used; custom roles grant only required permissions
3. **Time-Bound Access**: Privileged access auto-expires after 8 hours (requires re-request via PAM)
4. **Conditional Access**: Permissions granted only during business hours for non-emergency operations

**Example Least-Privilege Implementation**:

**CI/CD Service Account** (instead of Project Editor):
```hcl
permissions = [
  "storage.objects.create",      # Upload build artifacts
  "storage.objects.get",          # Download dependencies
  "logging.logEntries.create",   # Write audit logs
  "monitoring.timeSeries.create" # Send metrics
]
# Explicitly NOT granted: storage.objects.delete, storage.buckets.delete, iam.*
```

**Security Functions Least Privilege**:
- **Security Scanners**: Read-only access to code + write access to scan results bucket; CANNOT modify code
- **Backup Service**: Create snapshots + write to backup bucket; CANNOT delete production data
- **Monitoring**: Read metrics + create alerts; CANNOT modify monitored resources

**Privileged Account Controls**:
- Admin accounts used ONLY for break-glass emergencies (logged, alerted, reviewed within 24 hours)
- `roles/owner` granted to exactly 2 individuals (CTO + Security Lead) with hardware MFA requirement
- Service account impersonation logged and restricted to specific users

**Access Review Process**:
- Quarterly: All user permissions reviewed, manager attests to continued need
- Monthly: Service account permission audit, remove unused permissions
- Weekly: Privileged access grants reviewed, time-limited grants expired
- Daily: osquery monitors for privilege escalation attempts (sudo, setuid usage)

**Evidence**:
- IAM policy export showing custom roles and minimal permissions
- Quarterly access review reports (manager sign-off)
- osquery privilege escalation detection logs
- Conditional access policy configurations
- Privileged access approval and expiration logs

**Inheritance**: GCP IAM (FedRAMP High) provides fine-grained access control framework.

**Testing**: Attempt operation without permission (verify denial); Verify service account cannot exceed granted permissions; Validate privileged access expires after time limit.

### AC.L2-3.1.20 - Verify and control connections to external systems

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization verifies and controls/limits connections to and use of external information systems.

**Implementation Statement**:

Connections to external systems are inventoried, approved, monitored, and controlled through network policies and application-level restrictions:

**Approved External Connections**:
1. **Package Repositories** (read-only):
   - PyPI (pypi.org)
   - NPM (npmjs.com)
   - Docker Hub (hub.docker.com)
   - RubyGems (rubygems.org)
   - Connection: HTTPS only, artifact verification via checksums

2. **External APIs** (authenticated):
   - GitHub API (OAuth app with minimal scopes)
   - PagerDuty API (incident notifications)
   - Vulnerability Databases (NVD, OSV, Snyk)
   - Connection: API keys rotated every 90 days

3. **Cloud Provider Services** (within FedRAMP boundary):
   - GCP services (Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud KMS)
   - Connection: Service account authentication, VPC-SC perimeter

**Control Mechanisms**:

**1. Network-Level Controls**:
- Egress firewall rules whitelist specific external IPs/domains
- VPC-SC perimeter blocks unauthorized GCP service access
- Cloud NAT provides static egress IPs (logged)

**2. Application-Level Controls**:
- Dependency downloads verify checksums against known-good values
- Container base images pulled only from approved registries (verified by Cosign signatures)
- API calls use dedicated service accounts (not user credentials)

**3. Monitoring and Logging**:
- VPC flow logs capture all external connection attempts
- DNS queries logged (detect unauthorized external connections)
- API call logs include destination, payload size, response code

**Connection Approval Process**:
1. Developer submits request via JIRA (external system purpose, security review)
2. Security team evaluates: Is encryption enforced? Is authentication strong? Is data exposure minimized?
3. Network team adds firewall rule (time-limited trial period initially)
4. After 30-day evaluation, permanent approval or revocation

**Prohibited Connections**:
- Direct connections to untrusted Internet hosts from CUI zone
- Outbound connections on non-standard ports (blocked at VPC firewall)
- Unauthenticated API calls
- Connections to known malicious IPs (threat intelligence feed)

**Evidence**:
- External system inventory (documented in SSP, reviewed quarterly)
- Firewall rule configurations (egress allow-list)
- External connection approval tickets (JIRA)
- VPC flow logs showing allowed/denied external connections
- API usage logs (destination, authentication method)

**Inheritance**: GCP VPC Service Controls (FedRAMP High) enforces perimeter; Cloud Armor provides threat intelligence.

**Testing**: Attempt connection to non-approved external system (verify blocked); Validate firewall rules match approved inventory; Review connection logs for anomalies.

## DOMAIN 2: AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY (AU)

### AU.L2-3.3.1 - Create and retain system audit records to the extent needed to enable monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization creates and retains audit records to the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful, unauthorized, or inappropriate system activity.

**Implementation Statement**:

Comprehensive audit logging is implemented across all system components with appropriate retention and protection:

**Audit Record Coverage**:

**1. Application Logs** (Gitea):
- User authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
- Repository operations (clone, pull, push, fork, delete)
- Administrative actions (user creation, permission changes, settings modifications)
- API access (endpoint, method, user, response code, timestamp)
- Retention: 1 year hot storage, 6 additional years cold storage

**2. System Logs** (GCP Compute):
- OS-level events (service start/stop, package installation, kernel events)
- SSH access logs (source IP, username, session duration)
- sudo command execution (command, user, timestamp, working directory)
- File system changes to sensitive directories (/etc, /var/log)
- Retention: 90 days in Cloud Logging, 7 years in GCS archive

**3. Cloud Audit Logs**:
- Admin Activity: All API calls that modify configurations (1-year retention, cannot be disabled)
- Data Access: Read/write operations on GCS buckets and Cloud SQL (400-day retention)
- System Events: Automated GCP actions (instance maintenance, key rotation) (400-day retention)
- Policy Denied: Failed authorization attempts (400-day retention)

**4. Security Event Logs** (Wazuh SIEM):
- Intrusion detection alerts (file integrity changes, suspicious processes)
- Vulnerability detections (Trivy, Grype scan results)
- Policy violations (Checkov, tfsec findings)
- Incident response actions (containment, remediation)
- Retention: 3 years

**5. CI/CD Pipeline Logs**:
- Build initiation (trigger, branch, commit SHA)
- Security scan results (SAST, container scan, IaC scan)
- Deployment events (environment, artifact version, approver)
- Pipeline failures and rollbacks
- Retention: 1 year

**Audit Record Content** (per NIST SP 800-53 AU-3):
- Timestamp (UTC, ISO 8601 format)
- Event type (authentication, authorization, resource access, etc.)
- Subject identity (user, service account, process)
- Outcome (success/failure + error code)
- Source (IP address, hostname, user agent)
- Target resource (repository, file, API endpoint)

**Log Aggregation Architecture**:
```
Application Logs → Cloud Logging → BigQuery (analysis) → GCS (long-term archive)
                                 ↓
                           Loki (application logs) → Grafana (visualization)
                                 ↓
                           Wazuh (SIEM) → Elasticsearch (indexing)
```

**Evidence**:
- Daily log export archives (compressed JSON, SHA-256 hashed)
- Retention policy configurations (Cloud Logging bucket settings)
- Log completeness reports (verify no gaps in timestamp sequences)
- Log integrity verification (hash chains)
- Sample audit records demonstrating required content fields

**Inheritance**: GCP Cloud Logging (FedRAMP High) provides immutable log storage, retention enforcement, and audit trail protection.

**Testing**: Verify all event types generate logs; Validate retention policies prevent premature deletion; Test log export and hash verification; Confirm logs include all required fields.

### AU.L2-3.3.8 - Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization protects audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.

**Implementation Statement**:

Audit logs and logging infrastructure are protected through access controls, immutability, encryption, and monitoring:

**Access Controls**:

**1. Read Access** (Least Privilege):
- Security Operations: Read access to all logs for monitoring and incident investigation
- Compliance Team: Read access for audit evidence collection
- System Admins: Read access to system logs only (not application/security logs)
- Developers: NO access to audit logs (can view application debug logs only)

```hcl
# Cloud Logging IAM - Read-only for compliance team
resource "google_project_iam_member" "compliance_log_viewer" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/logging.viewer"
  member  = "group:compliance-team@example.com"
}

# Deny log deletion for everyone except log retention automation
resource "google_project_iam_member" "deny_log_deletion" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/logging.admin"
  member  = "deleted:serviceAccount:${google_service_account.log_retention_sa.email}"
  condition {
    title = "Deny manual log deletion"
    expression = "request.time < timestamp('2099-01-01T00:00:00Z')"  # Never allow
  }
}
```

**2. Modification Prevention** (Immutability):
- Cloud Logging: Logs are immutable once written (cannot be modified by any user)
- GCS Archive Bucket: Retention policy locked (prevents deletion before 7 years)
- BigQuery: Audit log tables are append-only (no UPDATE or DELETE permissions)

**3. Deletion Prevention**:
- Retention policies enforced at bucket level (overrides user delete attempts)
- `roles/logging.admin` NOT granted to any human users (only to automated retention service account)
- Cloud Logging sinks configured with `unique_writer_identity` (dedicated service account, monitored)

**Logging Tool Protection**:

**1. Loki (Application Log Aggregation)**:
- Runs in dedicated namespace with NetworkPolicy (ingress only from application pods)
- Authentication required for query API (OAuth2 proxy)
- Configuration stored in encrypted Kubernetes secrets

**2. Wazuh SIEM**:
- Manager runs on hardened VM (CIS Level 2 baseline)
- Web UI requires MFA (integrated with enterprise IdP)
- Agent-to-manager communication encrypted (TLS + pre-shared keys)

**3. Prometheus/Grafana**:
- Read-only datasource connections (cannot modify source data)
- Dashboard edit permissions restricted to Platform Engineering team
- Alert rules stored in version control (changes require PR approval)

**Encryption**:
- Logs in transit: TLS 1.3 from source to Cloud Logging
- Logs at rest: AES-256 encryption (GCS default, Cloud Logging storage)
- Archived logs: CMEK (customer-managed key in Cloud KMS)

**Monitoring of Audit System**:
- Alert on logging agent failure (AU.L2-3.3.4 implementation)
- Alert on unauthorized access attempts to log bucket
- Alert on retention policy modification attempts
- Daily verification of log integrity hashes

**Evidence**:
- IAM policy showing restricted log access
- Retention policy configurations (locked status)
- Failed unauthorized access attempts (logs showing permission denied)
- Log integrity hash chain
- Logging tool access logs (who accessed Grafana, Wazuh UI)

**Inheritance**: GCP Cloud Logging (FedRAMP High) provides immutable log storage with built-in integrity protection.

**Testing**: Attempt log modification as admin user (verify failure); Attempt premature log deletion (verify blocked by retention policy); Validate encryption at rest; Test log integrity verification.

## DOMAIN 3: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT (CM)

### CM.L2-3.4.1 - Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization establishes and maintains baseline configurations and inventories of organizational systems throughout the system development life cycles.

**Implementation Statement**:

System baselines are defined in Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), version controlled in Git, and continuously validated:

**Baseline Configuration Types**:

**1. Compute Instance Baseline** (CIS Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Benchmark Level 1):
- Hardened OS image built with Packer
- Security configurations: UFW firewall enabled, SSH key-only auth, fail2ban, auditd
- Monitoring agents: Prometheus node_exporter, Wazuh agent, osquery
- Patch level: All security updates applied at image build time
- Baseline version: `baseline-ubuntu-2204-v2.1.0` (tagged in GCR)

**2. Container Baseline** (CIS Docker Benchmark):
- Minimal base images (distroless or Alpine)
- Non-root user execution (USER directive in Dockerfile)
- Read-only root filesystem where possible
- No secrets in environment variables (use Secret Manager)
- Image signatures (Cosign) verify supply chain integrity

**3. Kubernetes Baseline** (CIS Kubernetes Benchmark V1.27):
- Pod Security Standards: Restricted profile enforced
- Network policies: Default deny ingress/egress
- RBAC: Least privilege service accounts
- Secrets encrypted at rest (Cloud KMS integration)

**4. Network Baseline**:
- VPC design: Separate subnets for build/production/management
- Firewall rules: Default deny, explicit allow for required services
- Cloud NAT: All egress through NAT gateway (static IPs)
- Private Google Access: Enabled (no public IPs on instances)

**5. Database Baseline** (PostgreSQL 14):
- Configuration: log_connections=on, log_disconnections=on, ssl=on
- Authentication: require_ssl=true, password_encryption=scram-sha-256
- Backup: Automated daily backups, 7-day PITR window
- Encryption: TDE enabled, CMEK encryption

**Configuration Inventory**:

**Automated Inventory Collection**:
- GCP Cloud Asset Inventory: Daily snapshot of all GCP resources (compute, storage, IAM, network)
- Export to BigQuery for analysis and compliance reporting
- Terraform state file: Authoritative source for infrastructure baseline
- Syft SBOM: Software Bill of Materials for all container images

**Inventory Contents**:
- Asset type and unique identifier
- Location (region/zone)
- Configuration parameters
- Assigned labels (environment, data classification, compliance scope)
- Last modified timestamp
- Baseline version reference

**Baseline Maintenance Process**:
1. **Quarterly Baseline Review**: Security team reviews CIS benchmark updates, new CVEs, configuration drift
2. **Baseline Update**: Updates documented in JIRA, changes made in Terraform/Packer, reviewed via PR
3. **Testing**: Updated baseline deployed to dev environment, validated with CIS-CAT scanner
4. **Approval**: Security Lead approves baseline version
5. **Rollout**: Gradual deployment to staging → production (with rollback capability)
6. **Verification**: Post-deployment validation, configuration drift detection

**Configuration Drift Detection**:
- Daily: Terraform plan detects drift from desired state
- Weekly: CIS-CAT scanner validates instances against CIS benchmark
- Real-time: Wazuh file integrity monitoring alerts on unauthorized changes to /etc/*

**Evidence**:
- Terraform modules defining baselines (version controlled in Git)
- Packer templates and build manifests
- GCP Asset Inventory exports (daily snapshots)
- CIS-CAT assessment reports (compliance scores)
- Configuration drift reports (Terraform plan, Wazuh FIM alerts)
- Baseline change approval records (JIRA + PR approvals)

**Inheritance**: GCP Cloud Asset Inventory (FedRAMP High) provides automated resource discovery and inventory.

**Testing**: Deploy instance from baseline image; Run CIS-CAT assessment (expect >95% compliance); Modify configuration manually; Verify drift detection within 24 hours.

---

### CM.L2-3.4.3 - Track, review, approve, and audit changes to systems

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization tracks, reviews, approves or disapproves, and audits changes to organizational systems.

**Implementation Statement**:

All system changes follow a formal GitOps change management process with automated enforcement:

**Change Management Workflow**:

**1. Proposal** (Track):
- Developer creates feature branch: `git checkout -b infra/add-monitoring-dashboard`
- Makes infrastructure changes in Terraform/Kubernetes manifests
- Commits with signed commit (GPG signature required)
- Opens Pull Request in Gitea

**2. Automated Review** (Audit):
- Atlantis automatically triggers `terraform plan`
- Security scans run: Checkov (IaC), tfsec (Terraform), Terrascan (policy)
- Cost analysis: Infracost generates monthly cost delta estimate
- Results posted as PR comments within 5 minutes

**3. Peer Review** (Review):
- Required reviewers (defined in CODEOWNERS file):
  - Infrastructure changes: Platform Engineering team member
  - Security-sensitive changes (IAM, KMS, VPC-SC): Security team member
  - Cost impact >$500/month: Engineering Manager
- Reviewers examine Terraform plan, security scan results, business justification
- Minimum 2 approvals required; author cannot approve own PR

**4. Approval** (Approve):
- After all required approvals, status checks pass, and reviews complete
- PR marked as "ready to merge"
- Merge to main branch triggers deployment process

**5. Deployment** (Audit):
- Atlantis detects merge to main
- Reviewer comments `atlantis apply` (explicit approval required, not automatic)
- Atlantis executes `terraform apply` with audit logging
- Deployment logs include: approver identity, timestamp, change summary
- Post-deployment: n8n workflow validates deployment success

**6. Verification** (Audit):
- Automated tests verify deployment (health checks, smoke tests)
- Configuration drift detection confirms actual state matches desired state
- Security posture re-scanned (ensure no regressions)

**Change Categories and Approval Requirements**:

| Change Type | Approval Required | Testing | Rollback Window |
|-------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Standard** (non-production config) | 1 peer approval | Unit tests | 24 hours |
| **Significant** (production, low-risk) | 2 peer approvals + security scan | Integration tests | 7 days |
| **Major** (IAM, network, security controls) | 2 peer + Security Lead | Full regression | 30 days |
| **Emergency** (security incident response) | Retroactive approval within 24h | Post-change validation | 48 hours |

**Change Tracking**:
- Git commits: Immutable change history with author, timestamp, changeset
- Pull requests: Discussion, review comments, approval timestamps
- Atlantis logs: Terraform plan/apply execution records
- JIRA tickets: Business justification, risk assessment
- Cloud Audit Logs: API calls made by Terraform during apply

**Audit Trail Components**:
1. **What changed**: Git diff, Terraform plan output
2. **Who requested**: PR author (GPG-signed commits prove identity)
3. **Who approved**: Reviewers who clicked "Approve" (logged with timestamp)
4. **When**: PR creation, review, merge, deployment timestamps
5. **Why**: PR description, linked JIRA ticket
6. **Result**: Terraform apply output, post-deployment validation results

**Unauthorized Change Prevention**:
- Direct push to main branch: BLOCKED (branch protection)
- Terraform apply without PR: BLOCKED (Atlantis is only actor with apply permission)
- Console UI changes to Terraform-managed resources: DETECTED (drift detection alerts within 1 hour)
- Emergency break-glass: Logged, alerted to security team, requires retroactive approval

**Evidence**:
- Git commit history (all changes tracked)
- Pull request records with approvals (exported monthly)
- Atlantis plan/apply audit logs
- Security scan results (pre-merge validation)
- Post-deployment verification reports
- Monthly change summary reports (approved vs. denied, change categories)

**Inheritance**: None (change management is organization-specific process).

**Testing**: Attempt unapproved change (verify blocked); Submit change without security scan passing (verify blocked); Review audit trail completeness for sample change.

## DOMAIN 4: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (IA)

### IA.L2-3.5.3 - Use multifactor authentication for local and network access to privileged accounts and for network access to non-privileged accounts

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization uses multifactor authentication for local and network access to privileged accounts and for network access to non-privileged accounts.

**Implementation Statement**:

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is universally enforced for all user access to the Gitea platform and underlying infrastructure:

**MFA Implementation by Access Type**:

**1. Gitea Web UI and API** (All Users):
- **Requirement**: MFA mandatory after 7-day grace period for new accounts
- **Methods Supported**:
  - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) via Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password
  - WebAuthn/FIDO2 hardware security keys (YubiKey, Titan)
  - U2F legacy hardware tokens
- **Enforcement**: Users without MFA enrolled see persistent banner; after grace period, login blocked until MFA configured
- **Recovery**: Scratch codes generated at enrollment (encrypted, stored in user profile)

**2. GCP Console and Cloud Shell** (All Users):
- **Requirement**: 2-Step Verification (2SV) enforced at Cloud Identity level
- **Methods**: TOTP, push notification (Google Prompt), SMS (fallback only)
- **Privileged Users** (roles/owner, roles/editor, custom roles with sensitive permissions):
  - **Required**: Hardware security key (FIDO2) - TOTP NOT sufficient
  - **Enforcement**: Conditional Access policy denies access without security key enrollment
- **Configuration**: Organization policy `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` restricts to managed Cloud Identity accounts (ensures 2SV control)

**3. SSH Access to Compute Instances**:
- **Standard Users**: SSH key + OTP (Google Authenticator PAM module)
- **Privileged Users** (sudo access): SSH key + OTP + JIT approval from PAM system
- **Configuration**:
  ```
  # /etc/pam.d/sshd
  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok
  auth required pam_permit.so
  ```

**4. VPN Access** (Remote Workers):
- **Requirement**: Certificate-based authentication + OTP
- **Certificate**: Client certificate issued by internal CA (bound to user identity)
- **OTP**: TOTP code required at VPN connection time
- **Device Posture**: BeyondCorp checks device compliance (OS version, disk encryption) before allowing connection

**5. Service Account Authentication** (Automated Processes):
- **No MFA** (service accounts cannot perform interactive MFA)
- **Compensating Control**: Workload Identity Federation binds service accounts to specific workloads (not exportable keys)
- **Monitoring**: Service account usage heavily monitored, unusual patterns alert SOC

**MFA Enrollment Process**:
1. New user account created
2. First login: Redirect to MFA enrollment page
3. User chooses method (TOTP or hardware key)
4. Enrollment: Scan QR code (TOTP) or tap key (WebAuthn)
5. Verification: User enters 6-digit code to confirm enrollment
6. Scratch codes: User saves recovery codes in password manager
7. Grace period: 7 days to enroll (after that, account locked until MFA added)

**MFA Compliance Monitoring**:
- Daily: Export user MFA enrollment status from Gitea and Cloud Identity
- Weekly: Report to Security team on non-compliant accounts (manual review for exceptions)
- Monthly: Manager attestation that all team members have MFA enabled
- Real-time: Alert on successful login without MFA (should never occur, indicates bypass attempt)

**MFA Bypass Prevention**:
- No admin override to disable MFA for user accounts
- Recovery codes: Single-use, rate-limited (5 attempts per hour)
- Backup authentication: If MFA device lost, user must submit ticket to Security team, verified via separate channel (phone call to manager)

**Evidence**:
- MFA enrollment reports (CSV export: username, MFA methods enrolled, enrollment date)
- Authentication logs showing MFA verification (TOTP verified, WebAuthn assertion validated)
- Non-compliant account tracking (should be zero after grace period)
- Conditional access policy configurations (require security key for privileged users)

**Inheritance**: GCP Cloud Identity (FedRAMP High) enforces 2-Step Verification; Gitea (open source) provides MFA via TOTP/WebAuthn.

**Testing**:
- New user login: Verify MFA enrollment required
- Privileged user: Verify hardware key requirement (TOTP should be denied)
- Failed MFA: Enter incorrect code 5 times, verify account lockout
- Verify service accounts cannot bypass MFA (not applicable to them, but user impersonation requires user MFA)

## DOMAIN 5: INCIDENT RESPONSE (IR)

### IR.L2-3.6.1 - Establish an operational incident-handling capability

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization establishes an operational incident-handling capability for organizational systems that includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, recovery, and user response activities.

**Implementation Statement**:

A comprehensive, automated incident response capability is implemented with defined procedures for each phase:

**1. Preparation**:
- **Incident Response Plan**: Documented procedures for security incidents, approved annually
- **Runbooks**: Automated playbooks for common incident types (malware, data breach, DDoS, insider threat)
- **Team**: Security Ops Center (SOC) staffed 24/7, on-call rotation for escalations
- **Tools**: Wazuh SIEM, n8n workflow automation, Ansible remediation playbooks, PagerDuty alerting
- **Training**: Quarterly tabletop exercises, monthly simulated incident drills
- **Contacts**: Communication tree (internal team, legal, PR, customers), verified quarterly

**2. Detection**:
- **Automated Detection**:
  - Wazuh SIEM: Monitors security events, correlates indicators of compromise (IOCs)
  - Falco: Detects runtime anomalies (unexpected process execution, network connections)
  - Security Command Center: GCP resource misconfigurations, vulnerabilities
  - Prometheus + AlertManager: Performance anomalies, resource exhaustion
- **Detection Rules**: Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework (tactics, techniques)
- **Example Detection**:
  ```yaml
  # Wazuh rule: Brute force authentication attempt
  <rule id="100100" level="12">
    <if_group>authentication_failed</if_group>
    <same_source_ip />
    <different_user />
    <timeframe>120</timeframe>
    <frequency>5</frequency>
    <description>Multiple failed login attempts - Brute Force Attack</description>
    <mitre>
      <id>T1110</id>
    </mitre>
  </rule>
  ```

**3. Analysis**:
- **Automated Triage**: n8n workflow classifies severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on:
  - MITRE ATT&CK tactic (initial access vs. exfiltration)
  - Affected asset criticality (production vs. dev)
  - Data classification (CUI vs. public)
- **Enrichment**: Correlate alert with context:
  - User recent activity (was user traveling? Is this normal working hours?)
  - Asset vulnerability status (is this system known-vulnerable?)
  - Threat intelligence (is source IP known malicious?)
- **Investigation Tools**: Wazuh event search, Cloud Logging queries, VPC flow log analysis
- **Timeline**: Automated timeline generation from correlated logs

**4. Containment**:
- **Short-term Containment** (Automated via n8n + Ansible):
  - **Network Isolation**: Modify VPC firewall to block traffic to/from affected instance
  - **Account Suspension**: Disable compromised user account in Gitea and Cloud IAM
  - **Process Kill**: Terminate malicious process on affected host
  - **Example Ansible Playbook**:
    ```yaml
    - name: Isolate compromised host
      hosts: "{{ affected_host }}"
      tasks:
        - name: Block all outbound traffic
          iptables:
            chain: OUTPUT
            policy: DROP
        - name: Allow SSH from jumphost only
          iptables:
            chain: INPUT
            source: "{{ jumphost_ip }}"
            protocol: tcp
            destination_port: 22
            jump: ACCEPT
    ```
- **Long-term Containment**:
  - Patch vulnerable system
  - Rotate compromised credentials
  - Update security policies to prevent recurrence

**5. Eradication**:
- **Remove Threat**:
  - Delete malware files (verified by hash)
  - Close unauthorized accounts
  - Remove backdoors
- **Patch Vulnerabilities**: Apply security updates that allowed compromise
- **Rebuild**: If integrity compromised, rebuild from known-good baseline image

**6. Recovery**:
- **Restore Services**:
  - Bring isolated systems back online after verification
  - Restore from clean backup if needed
- **Validation**:
  - Scan for residual malware
  - Verify system configurations match baseline
  - Monitor for signs of persistent threat
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Temporary increased logging/alerting on recovered systems (30-day period)

**7. Post-Incident Activity**:
- **Documentation**: JIRA incident ticket with complete timeline, actions taken, root cause
- **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review within 5 business days
  - What worked well?
  - What could be improved?
  - Playbook updates needed?
- **Reporting**:
  - Executive summary to leadership (within 24 hours)
  - Detailed incident report (within 7 days)
  - Regulatory notifications if required (e.g., data breach notification)

**Incident Workflow (n8n Automation)**:
```
Wazuh Alert → Severity Triage → Create JIRA Ticket
                              → Page On-Call (if CRITICAL)
                              → Execute Containment Playbook
                              → Notify Security Team (Google Chat)
                              → Collect Forensic Evidence
                              → Update Ticket Status
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): Target <5 minutes
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR): Target <15 minutes for containment
- Incident volume: Trend analysis for proactive defense
- False positive rate: Tune detection rules to <5%

**Evidence**:
- Incident Response Plan (reviewed annually)
- Incident tickets (JIRA exports with full timeline)
- Playbook execution logs (Ansible, n8n workflows)
- Tabletop exercise reports (scenarios, participant feedback, action items)
- Detection rule repository (Wazuh, Falco rules version-controlled)
- Incident metrics dashboard (Grafana)

**Inheritance**: None (incident response is organization-specific).

**Testing**:
- Monthly: Simulated phishing email, verify detection and user reporting
- Quarterly: Tabletop exercise (ransomware, insider threat, DDoS scenarios)
- Annually: Full incident response drill with live containment (in isolated environment)

## DOMAIN 6: RISK ASSESSMENT (RA)

### RA.L2-3.11.2 - Scan for vulnerabilities in systems and applications periodically and when new vulnerabilities affecting the systems are identified

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization scans for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and applications periodically and when new vulnerabilities affecting those systems are identified and reported; takes action to address newly identified vulnerabilities.

**Implementation Statement**:

Comprehensive vulnerability scanning is performed continuously across all system layers with defined remediation timelines:

**Scanning Scope and Frequency**:

**1. Source Code (SAST)** - Every Commit:
- **Tool**: SonarQube, Semgrep, Bandit
- **Scope**: All code in pull requests before merge
- **Vulnerabilities Detected**: SQL injection, XSS, insecure deserialization, hardcoded secrets, OWASP Top 10
- **Action**: CRITICAL/HIGH findings block PR merge (quality gate failure)
- **Evidence**: Scan reports attached to PR, stored in gs://compliance-evidence-store/ra-3.11.2/sast/

**2. Container Images** - Every Build + Daily Registry Scan:
- **Tool**: Trivy, Grype
- **Scope**: All container images before promotion to production registry
- **Vulnerabilities Detected**: OS package CVEs, application dependency CVEs, exposed secrets, misconfigurations
- **Action**:
  - CRITICAL vulnerabilities block image push
  - HIGH vulnerabilities generate JIRA ticket (7-day SLA)
  - Daily scan of existing registry images (detect newly-published CVEs)
- **Evidence**: Scan reports (JSON, SARIF), SBOM (CycloneDX, SPDX)

**3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** - Every PR + Weekly Full Scan:
- **Tool**: Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan
- **Scope**: Terraform configurations, Kubernetes manifests
- **Vulnerabilities Detected**: Misconfigurations (unencrypted storage, overly-permissive IAM, missing logging)
- **Action**: Policy violations block terraform apply via Atlantis
- **Evidence**: Policy scan results (JSON), Terraform plan with security annotations

**4. Runtime Applications (DAST)** - Weekly (Staging), Monthly (Production):
- **Tool**: OWASP ZAP
- **Scope**: Web applications and APIs (authenticated scans)
- **Vulnerabilities Detected**: Authentication bypasses, injection flaws, broken access control
- **Action**: HIGH findings trigger emergency patch process
- **Evidence**: ZAP HTML reports, exported findings (XML)

**5. Cloud Infrastructure** - Continuous (Real-time):
- **Tool**: GCP Security Command Center
- **Scope**: All GCP resources (compute, storage, IAM, network)
- **Vulnerabilities Detected**: Unencrypted disks, public storage buckets, weak IAM bindings, outdated VM images
- **Action**:
  - CRITICAL findings auto-remediate where possible (close public bucket)
  - Others create JIRA tickets with SLA based on severity
- **Evidence**: Security Command Center findings export (daily snapshot)

**6. Operating Systems and Packages** - Weekly:
- **Tool**: Trivy, native package managers (apt)
- **Scope**: All compute instances and container base images
- **Vulnerabilities Detected**: Unpatched OS packages, end-of-life software versions
- **Action**: Automated patch deployment via Ansible (for CRITICAL), manual review for others
- **Evidence**: Package vulnerability reports, patch deployment logs

**Vulnerability Remediation SLAs**:
| Severity | CVSS Score | Remediation Timeline | Auto-Remediation | Escalation |
|----------|------------|---------------------|------------------|------------|
| CRITICAL | 9.0-10.0 + Exploited in Wild | 24 hours | Yes (with rollback plan) | Immediate page to Security Lead |
| HIGH | 7.0-8.9 | 7 days | Partial (non-prod first) | Email to Security Team |
| MEDIUM | 4.0-6.9 | 30 days | No | Sprint planning |
| LOW | 0.1-3.9 | 90 days or next major release | No | Backlog review |

**New Vulnerability Monitoring**:
- **CVE Feeds**: Subscribed to NVD, OSV, GitHub Security Advisories, vendor security mailing lists
- **SBOM Correlation**: Daily comparison of SBOMs against latest CVE databases
  - If new CVE published affecting our dependency, auto-generate JIRA ticket
- **Vulnerability Databases**: Trivy updates database hourly, Grype daily
- **Zero-Day Response**: Emergency patch process for actively-exploited zero-days (24-hour window)

**Remediation Workflow**:
1. **Detection**: Vulnerability scanner identifies CVE-2024-1234 in package `openssl` version `1.1.1k`
2. **Ticket Creation**: n8n workflow creates JIRA ticket "SEC-1234: CVE-2024-1234 in openssl"
   - Assigns to: Package owner (determined by CODEOWNERS file)
   - Due date: Calculated from severity SLA
   - Links: CVE details, affected systems inventory
3. **Remediation**:
   - Developer updates package version in Dockerfile/requirements.txt
   - Submits PR, security scan validates fix
   - PR merged, new image built and scanned (vulnerability absent)
4. **Verification**:
   - Re-scan confirms CVE no longer present
   - JIRA ticket auto-closed by n8n workflow
5. **Exception Process** (if fix not available):
   - Developers document compensating controls (WAF rule, network isolation)
   - Security team reviews and approves exception
   - Exception tracked in risk register, reviewed monthly

**Scan Coverage Validation**:
- Weekly: Verify all repositories have recent scan results (no scan staleness >7 days)
- Monthly: Audit scan tool configurations (ensure all vulnerability signatures up-to-date)
- Quarterly: Penetration test validates scanner effectiveness (pen tester should find few/no vulns that scanners missed)

**Evidence**:
- Vulnerability scan reports (daily exports to gs://compliance-evidence-store/)
- SBOM files for all production artifacts
- Remediation tracking (JIRA ticket history showing finding → fix → verification)
- SLA compliance reports (percentage of vulnerabilities remediated within SLA)
- Exception approvals (documented compensating controls)

**Inheritance**: GCP Security Command Center (FedRAMP High) provides continuous cloud resource vulnerability scanning.

**Testing**:
- Deploy vulnerable application, verify scanner detects
- Publish simulated CVE affecting dependency, verify alert within 1 hour
- Test SLA escalation (create overdue ticket, verify manager notification)
- Validate scan coverage (spot-check 10 random repositories, confirm recent scans)

## DOMAIN 7: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION (SC)

### SC.L2-3.13.11 - Employ cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of CUI during storage

**Assessment Objective**: Determine if the organization employs FIPS-validated cryptography to protect the confidentiality of CUI during storage (data at rest).

**Implementation Statement**:

All CUI stored within the Gitea DevSecOps platform is protected with FIPS 140-2 validated encryption at rest:

**Encryption Implementation by Storage Type**:

**1. Cloud Storage Buckets (GCS)**:
- **Encryption Method**: Default Google-managed encryption (FIPS 140-2 validated) + Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for CUI buckets
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Management**: Cloud KMS with HSM-backed keys (FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSM)
- **Configuration**:
  ```hcl
  resource "google_storage_bucket" "cui_repos" {
    name = "gitea-cui-repositories"
    encryption {
      default_kms_key_name = google_kms_crypto_key.cui_key.id
    }
  }
  ```
- **Verification**: `gsutil stat gs://gitea-cui-repositories/object` shows "Encryption: Customer-managed key"

**2. Cloud SQL Database** (Gitea application data):
- **Encryption Method**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) + CMEK
- **Algorithm**: AES-256
- **Key Management**: Cloud KMS (same key ring as GCS for CUI)
- **Backup Encryption**: Automated backups encrypted with same CMEK
- **Configuration**: `encryption_key_name = google_kms_crypto_key.cui_key.id`

**3. Persistent Disks** (Compute Engine):
- **Encryption Method**: Default encryption + CMEK for CUI workloads
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-XTS
- **Key Management**: Cloud KMS
- **Snapshot Encryption**: Snapshots inherit encryption from source disk

**4. Secrets** (API keys, credentials):
- **Encryption Method**: Secret Manager with automatic encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM with envelope encryption
- **Key Hierarchy**:
  - Data Encryption Key (DEK) encrypts secret
  - Key Encryption Key (KEK) in Cloud KMS encrypts DEK
  - KEK never leaves HSM
- **Access Logging**: All secret access logged (who, when, which secret)

**5. Backup Storage**:
- **Gitea Backup**: PostgreSQL dumps encrypted with GPG before upload to GCS
- **GPG Key**: 4096-bit RSA key stored in Cloud KMS
- **Retention**: 7 years for compliance-related backups

**Key Management**:

**Key Rotation**:
- **Automated Rotation**: Cloud KMS keys rotate every 90 days automatically
- **Re-encryption**: Not required (envelope encryption - only new writes use new key version, old data still accessible)
- **Verification**: Daily check of key rotation schedule compliance

**Key Access Control**:
- **IAM Policy**: Only authorized service accounts can use encryption keys
- **No Export**: Cloud KMS keys cannot be exported (FIPS 140-2 requirement)
- **Audit Logging**: All key usage operations logged (Encrypt, Decrypt, Sign)

**FIPS Validation**:
- **GCP Encryption**: FIPS 140-2 validated (Certificate #3318, #3249, #3451)
- **Cloud KMS HSM**: FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated hardware
- **Validation Evidence**: [https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/fips-140-2-validated](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/fips-140-2-validated)

**CUI Data Classification**:
- **Labeling**: All resources containing CUI tagged with `data_classification: cui`
- **Automated Enforcement**: Terraform policy requires CMEK for any resource with `data_classification: cui` label
- **Validation**: Daily scan identifies CUI resources, verifies encryption enabled

**Encryption Verification**:
```bash
# Daily encryption compliance check
gcloud storage buckets list --format=json | jq '
  .[] |
  select(.labels.data_classification == "cui") |
  {
    name: .name,
    encrypted: (.encryption.defaultKmsKeyName != null),
    key: .encryption.defaultKmsKeyName
  }
'
```

**Prohibited Practices**:
- Storing CUI in plain text (prevented by pre-commit hooks scanning for sensitive patterns)
- Using Google-managed keys for CUI (policy requires CMEK)
- Disabling encryption on CUI resources (Terraform validation prevents)

**Evidence**:
- KMS key inventory (key ID, rotation schedule, protection level)
- Encryption verification reports (daily scan of all CUI resources)
- Key usage audit logs (showing Encrypt/Decrypt operations)
- FIPS 140-2 validation certificates (Cloud KMS)
- Unencrypted CUI detection scans (should report zero findings)

**Inheritance**:
- GCP Cloud KMS (FedRAMP High, FIPS 140-2 Level 3) provides cryptographic key management
- GCP encryption at rest (FedRAMP High) provides default encryption for all storage services

**Testing**:
- Create CUI bucket without CMEK, verify Terraform apply fails
- Verify encryption at rest: Upload test file, confirm `gsutil stat` shows encryption
- Key rotation test: Trigger manual rotation, verify new key version created, old data still accessible
- Access control test: Attempt to use encryption key without IAM permission (verify denied)
