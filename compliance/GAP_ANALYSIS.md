## GAP IDENTIFICATION METHODOLOGY

### Assessment Approach

**1. Documentation Review**:
- System Security Plan (SSP)
- Control implementation statements
- Technical configuration documentation
- Evidence artifacts

**2. Technical Testing**:
- Automated compliance scanning (CIS-CAT, Checkov, tfsec)
- Manual penetration testing
- Configuration validation
- Evidence collection verification

**3. Interviews**:
- System administrators
- Security operations team
- Compliance personnel
- Development team

**4. Evidence Validation**:
- Verify evidence artifacts exist
- Validate evidence integrity (hash verification)
- Confirm retention meets requirements
- Test evidence retrieval process

### Gap Classification

**FULL**: Control fully implemented, automated, with complete evidence trail
**PARTIAL**: Control implemented but missing automation, documentation, or evidence
**MANUAL**: Control requires manual process (not a gap if documented and performed)
**GAP**: Control not implemented or implementation insufficient

---

## ACCESS CONTROL (AC) GAPS

### AC-2(13) - Account Monitoring for Atypical Usage

**NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Reference**: AC-2(13)
**CMMC Mapping**: Related to AC.L2-3.1.5 (Least Privilege)
**Current Implementation Status**: PARTIAL

**Gap Description**:
While authentication logs are collected and stored, there is no automated detection of atypical account usage patterns (e.g., user logging in from unusual location, unusual time of day, accessing resources outside normal scope).

**Risk**:
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Delayed detection of compromised credentials or insider threats
- **Likelihood**: LOW - MFA and least privilege reduce exploitation window
- **Overall Risk**: LOW

**Current Controls**:
- Authentication logs collected (Cloud Logging)
- Manual review of access logs during quarterly access reviews
- Alerting on failed login attempts (brute force detection)

**Compensating Controls**:
- MFA required for all users (reduces credential compromise risk)
- Least privilege access (limits damage from compromised account)
- Quarterly access reviews detect unauthorized access (delayed)

**Recommended Solution**:
Implement User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) solution:
- **Tool**: Chronicle Security or Splunk UEBA
- **Capabilities**:
  - Baseline normal user behavior (login times, accessed resources, data transfer volume)
  - Detect anomalies (login from new location, privilege escalation, unusual data access)
  - Risk scoring (aggregate anomaly indicators into user risk score)
- **Integration**: Ingest Cloud Logging and Gitea audit logs
- **Alerting**: Trigger incident workflow for high-risk score users

**Estimated Effort**: 6 weeks (tool procurement, integration, baseline training period)
**Estimated Cost**: $15,000/year (SaaS UEBA tool)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Target Completion**: 2025-12-15 (Week 10 of implementation roadmap)

### AC-6(9) - Log Use of Privileged Functions

**NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Reference**: AC-6(9)
**CMMC Mapping**: Related to AC.L2-3.1.5 and AU.L2-3.3.1
**Current Implementation Status**: PARTIAL

**Gap Description**:
While general access logs capture admin actions, there is no specific log filter and alert for privileged function execution (sudo, IAM policy changes, KMS key usage). Logs exist but require manual search to identify privileged operations.

**Risk**:
- **Impact**: LOW - Delayed detection of unauthorized privileged actions
- **Likelihood**: LOW - Least privilege and MFA limit privileged access
- **Overall Risk**: LOW

**Current Controls**:
- All sudo commands logged via auditd
- Cloud Audit Logs capture IAM/KMS API calls
- Logs retained for 3 years

**Compensating Controls**:
- Dual approval required for sensitive privileged operations (two-person rule)
- Weekly review of IAM policy changes
- Real-time alerting on KMS key deletion attempts

**Recommended Solution**:
Create dedicated log sink and alert rules for privileged operations:

```yaml
# Cloud Logging filter for privileged operations
resource "google_logging_metric" "privileged_operations" {
  name   = "privileged_operations_count"
  filter = <<-EOT
    protoPayload.methodName=~"(SetIamPolicy|CreateCryptoKey|DeleteCryptoKey)" OR
    protoPayload.authorizationInfo.permission=~"iam.roles.*" OR
    logName=~"sudo"
  EOT
  metric_descriptor {
    metric_kind = "DELTA"
    value_type  = "INT64"
  }
}

# Alert on privileged operation
resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "privileged_operation_alert" {
  display_name = "Privileged Operation Executed"
  conditions {
    display_name = "Privileged operation rate"
    condition_threshold {
      filter          = "resource.type=\"global\" AND metric.type=\"logging.googleapis.com/user/privileged_operations_count\""
      comparison      = "COMPARISON_GT"
      threshold_value = 0
      duration        = "0s"
    }
  }
  notification_channels = [google_monitoring_notification_channel.security_team.id]
}
```

**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks (log filter creation, alert tuning, dashboard creation)
**Estimated Cost**: $0 (uses existing infrastructure)
**Priority**: LOW (compensating controls adequate)
**Target Completion**: 2025-11-15 (Week 6 of implementation roadmap)

## CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT (CM) GAPS

### CM-3(7) - Automated Enforcement of Unauthorized Change Restrictions

**NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Reference**: CM-3(7)
**CMMC Mapping**: Related to CM.L2-3.4.3 (Change Control)
**Current Implementation Status**: PARTIAL

**Gap Description**:
While unauthorized changes to Terraform-managed infrastructure are detected via drift detection (daily terraform plan), changes made directly via GCP Console to non-Terraform-managed resources (manual VM changes, firewall rule modifications) are not automatically reverted.

**Risk**:
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Unauthorized configuration changes could introduce vulnerabilities
- **Likelihood**: LOW - Training emphasizes GitOps, console access restricted
- **Overall Risk**: LOW

**Current Controls**:
- Daily terraform plan detects drift in Terraform-managed resources
- Cloud Audit Logs capture all GCP Console changes
- Weekly review of audit logs for manual changes

**Compensating Controls**:
- GitOps policy requires all infrastructure changes via Terraform
- Console access limited to break-glass emergency accounts (rarely used)
- Monthly configuration baseline validation (CIS-CAT scanner)

**Recommended Solution**:
Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) and configuration enforcement:

**Phase 1** - Detection (Immediate):
- Deploy Wazuh FIM module to monitor critical configuration files
  - `/etc/*` (system configuration)
  - `/var/www/*` (web application files)
  - `~/.ssh/*` (SSH keys)
- Alert on unauthorized modification within 5 minutes

**Phase 2** - Automated Remediation (Week 4):
- Ansible playbook triggered by FIM alert to revert unauthorized change
- Example:
  ```yaml
  - name: Revert unauthorized SSH configuration change
    copy:
      src: "{{ baseline_sshd_config }}"
      dest: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      backup: yes
    notify: restart_ssh
    when: fim_alert.file == "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
  ```

**Phase 3** - Console Change Prevention (Week 8):
- Organization policy to restrict GCP Console modifications:
  ```hcl
  resource "google_org_policy_policy" "restrict_console_changes" {
    name   = "organizations/${var.org_id}/policies/iam.disableServiceAccountCreation"
    parent = "organizations/${var.org_id}"
    spec {
      rules {
        enforce = "TRUE"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

**Estimated Effort**: 8 weeks (FIM deployment, playbook development, policy enforcement)
**Estimated Cost**: $0 (Wazuh already deployed, Ansible infrastructure exists)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Target Completion**: 2025-12-01 (Week 8 of implementation roadmap)

## IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (IA) GAPS

### IA-5(13) - PKI-Based Authentication

**NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Reference**: IA-5(13)
**CMMC Mapping**: Related to IA.L2-3.5.3 (MFA)
**Current Implementation Status**: GAP

**Gap Description**:
The system does not currently support PKI-based authentication with Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards or similar. Current MFA relies on TOTP and FIDO2 hardware keys, which do not use PKI certificates.

**Risk**:
- **Impact**: LOW - Current MFA methods (TOTP, FIDO2) provide equivalent security
- **Likelihood**: N/A - No requirement for PIV card authentication unless mandated by contract
- **Overall Risk**: INFORMATIONAL (not a security gap, but may be required for government contracts)

**Current Controls**:
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) MFA for all users
- FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware security keys for privileged users
- Client certificate authentication for service-to-service communication (mTLS)

**Compensating Controls**:
- FIDO2 hardware keys provide similar assurance level to PIV cards (both are "something you have" factors)
- MFA enforcement prevents credential compromise

**Recommended Solution** (if PIV requirement emerges):

**Phase 1** - PKI Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4):
- Deploy HashiCorp Vault as internal Certificate Authority
- Configure certificate issuance policies (key length, validity period, subject DN format)
- Integrate with Cloud IAM for certificate-based authentication

**Phase 2** - Gitea Integration (Weeks 5-8):
- Configure Gitea to accept client certificates for authentication
- Map certificate subject DN to Gitea user accounts
- Enforce certificate revocation checking (OCSP)

**Phase 3** - User Enrollment (Weeks 9-12):
- Issue certificates to users (via self-service portal or admin issuance)
- Provide enrollment documentation and training
- Gradual rollout (pilot group → all users)

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
# Gitea app.ini - Client certificate authentication
[server]
CERT_FILE = /path/to/server.crt
KEY_FILE  = /path/to/server.key
CLIENT_CERT_VERIFICATION = request
CA_FILE   = /path/to/ca.crt

[auth.client_cert]
ENABLED = true
SUBJECT_DN_REGEX = CN=([^,]+)
```

**Estimated Effort**: 12 weeks (PKI infrastructure, integration, user enrollment)
**Estimated Cost**: $25,000 (HashiCorp Vault Enterprise, smart card readers)
**Priority**: LOW (defer until contract requires PIV authentication)
**Target Completion**: ON HOLD (implement only if required by contract)

## INCIDENT RESPONSE (IR) GAPS

### IR-4(1) - Automated Incident Handling Processes

**NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Reference**: IR-4(1)
**CMMC Mapping**: Related to IR.L2-3.6.1 (Incident Handling)
**Current Implementation Status**: PARTIAL

**Gap Description**:
While incident detection and containment are partially automated (n8n workflows, Ansible playbooks), some incident response steps still require manual intervention:
- **Manual Steps**: Root cause analysis, forensic evidence collection (non-automated systems), legal notification decisions
- **Automated Steps**: Detection, triage, containment, basic remediation

**Risk**:
- **Impact**: LOW - Manual steps acceptable for complex incidents requiring human judgment
- **Likelihood**: N/A - Not all incident response can/should be automated
- **Overall Risk**: INFORMATIONAL (not a true gap, but opportunity for optimization)

**Current Controls**:
- Automated detection via Wazuh SIEM
- Automated containment playbooks (network isolation, account suspension)
- Manual forensic analysis using standard tools (Volatility, Wireshark, log analysis)

**Compensating Controls**:
- Documented incident response procedures
- Quarterly tabletop exercises ensure team familiarity with manual procedures
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) meets target (<15 minutes for containment)

**Recommended Enhancement** (optimization, not gap closure):

Implement automated forensic evidence collection:

```yaml
# n8n workflow addition: Automated forensic collection
- name: Capture Forensic Snapshot
  type: n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand
  parameters:
    command: |
      # Snapshot disk for forensic analysis
      gcloud compute disks snapshot {{ affected_instance }}-disk \
        --snapshot-names=forensic-{{ incident_id }}-{{ timestamp }} \
        --zone={{ instance_zone }}

      # Capture memory dump (if instance running)
      gcloud compute ssh {{ affected_instance }} --command="
        sudo apt-get install -y lime-forensics-dkms
        sudo insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/lime.ko 'path=/tmp/memdump.lime format=lime'
        sudo gsutil cp /tmp/memdump.lime gs://forensic-evidence/{{ incident_id }}/
      "

      # Export relevant logs
      gcloud logging read "resource.labels.instance_id={{ instance_id }} AND timestamp>='{{ incident_start_time }}'" \
        --format=json > /tmp/incident-logs.json
      gsutil cp /tmp/incident-logs.json gs://forensic-evidence/{{ incident_id }}/

      # Calculate hashes for chain of custody
      sha256sum /tmp/memdump.lime > /tmp/forensic-hashes.txt
      sha256sum /tmp/incident-logs.json >> /tmp/forensic-hashes.txt
      gsutil cp /tmp/forensic-hashes.txt gs://forensic-evidence/{{ incident_id }}/
```

**Estimated Effort**: 4 weeks (workflow development, testing, documentation)
**Estimated Cost**: $0 (uses existing infrastructure)
**Priority**: LOW (optimization, not compliance gap)
**Target Completion**: 2026-Q1 (post-CMMC assessment)

## RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) GAPS

### RA-3(1) - Supply Chain Risk Assessment

**NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Reference**: RA-3(1)
**CMMC Mapping**: Related to RA.L2-3.11.1 (Risk Assessment)
**Current Implementation Status**: PARTIAL

**Gap Description**:
While technical supply chain risks are addressed (SBOM generation, dependency scanning, container signature verification), formal supplier risk assessments are not performed for all third-party services:
- **Assessed**: GCP (FedRAMP High certification reviewed), GitHub (security posture reviewed)
- **Not Formally Assessed**: SaaS tools (PagerDuty, Grafana Cloud, Slack - usage accepted on vendor reputation, no formal risk assessment)

**Risk**:
- **Impact**: LOW - Third-party service compromise could expose limited data
- **Likelihood**: LOW - Reputable vendors with security certifications
- **Overall Risk**: LOW

**Current Controls**:
- Vendor selection criteria include security certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Contracts include security requirements and breach notification clauses
- Data minimization: Only necessary data shared with third-party services
- Regular access review: Third-party integrations reviewed quarterly

**Compensating Controls**:
- Technical supply chain security: SBOM, signature verification, vulnerability scanning
- Least privilege integration: API keys with minimal permissions
- Monitoring: Third-party service usage monitored, anomalies alerted

**Recommended Solution**:

Implement formal Supplier Risk Assessment Program:

**Phase 1** - Risk Assessment Framework (Week 1-2):
- Create supplier risk assessment questionnaire (security controls, incident history, compliance certifications)
- Define risk tiers: CRITICAL (access to CUI), HIGH (access to internal systems), MEDIUM (limited access), LOW (public-facing only)
- Document risk acceptance criteria

**Phase 2** - Assess Current Suppliers (Week 3-6):
- Distribute questionnaire to all current third-party service providers
- Review security documentation (SOC 2 reports, penetration test results)
- Assign risk tier and document in supplier risk register
- Identify high-risk suppliers requiring remediation or replacement

**Phase 3** - Ongoing Assessment (Week 7+):
- Annual re-assessment for CRITICAL/HIGH tier suppliers
- Biennial re-assessment for MEDIUM/LOW tier suppliers
- Continuous monitoring via vendor security news feeds

**Supplier Risk Register Example**:
| Vendor | Service | Risk Tier | Data Exposed | Last Assessment | Next Assessment | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| GCP | Cloud Infrastructure | CRITICAL | CUI | 2025-09-01 | 2026-09-01 | FedRAMP High certified |
| PagerDuty | Incident Alerting | HIGH | Incident metadata | 2025-10-01 | 2026-10-01 | SOC 2 Type II certified |
| Grafana Cloud | Metrics Visualization | MEDIUM | System metrics (no CUI) | NOT ASSESSED | 2025-11-01 | ISO 27001 certified |

**Estimated Effort**: 6 weeks (framework development, initial assessments)
**Estimated Cost**: $5,000 (consultant to develop framework, ongoing internal resources)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Target Completion**: 2025-12-15 (Week 10 of implementation roadmap)

## SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION (SC) GAPS

### SC-8(5) - Cryptographic Protection of Information at Rest - Key Escrow

**NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Reference**: SC-8(5)
**CMMC Mapping**: Related to SC.L2-3.13.16 (Encryption at Rest)
**Current Implementation Status**: PARTIAL

**Gap Description**:
While encryption keys are managed in Cloud KMS with HSM backing, there is no formal key escrow mechanism for legal/regulatory scenarios (e.g., law enforcement access, employee data recovery after termination).

**Risk**:
- **Impact**: LOW - Inability to decrypt data if all key access is lost (unlikely with Cloud KMS)
- **Likelihood**: VERY LOW - Cloud KMS provides key recovery mechanisms
- **Overall Risk**: INFORMATIONAL (business continuity consideration, not security gap)

**Current Controls**:
- Cloud KMS automatic key replication across regions (prevents single-region failure)
- Multiple IAM principals authorized to access keys (prevents single person dependency)
- Terraform state backup includes key references (can recreate key permissions)

**Compensating Controls**:
- Break-glass emergency access procedure (CTO can grant temporary key access)
- Key versioning: Old key versions retained for data encrypted with previous versions
- GCP support can assist with key recovery in catastrophic scenarios

**Recommended Solution** (if legal/regulatory escrow required):

**Option 1** - Internal Key Escrow (Security Compliance):
- Export encrypted key backups to offline storage (USB HSM in safe)
- Dual custody: Requires two executives (CTO + CFO) to access
- Annual audit of escrow integrity

**Option 2** - Third-Party Key Escrow (Regulatory Compliance):
- Use Cloud External Key Manager (Cloud EKM) with key escrow service
- Escrow agent (e.g., Iron Mountain) holds key recovery material
- Legal process required to release keys to authorized party

**Implementation** (Option 1):
```bash
# Export key backup (encrypted with escrow master key)
gcloud kms keys versions describe 1 \
  --key=cui-storage-encryption-key \
  --keyring=cui-keyring \
  --location=us-central1 \
  --format=json | \
  gpg --encrypt --recipient escrow-master@example.com > key-backup-2025-10-05.gpg

# Store on offline HSM (manual procedure)
# 1. Copy encrypted backup to USB drive
# 2. Store USB drive in company safe (dual custody required)
# 3. Document in escrow log (date, key version, custodians)
```

**Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks (procedure documentation, initial escrow, audit process)
**Estimated Cost**: $2,000 (USB HSM device, safe storage)
**Priority**: LOW (defer unless regulatory requirement identified)
**Target Completion**: ON HOLD (implement only if legal/regulatory requirement emerges)

---

**Priority Definitions**:
- **HIGH**: Address immediately (critical compliance gap or high security risk)
- **MEDIUM**: Address within 16 weeks (moderate risk, reasonable effort)
- **LOW**: Address as resources permit (low risk, technical debt)
- **INFORMATIONAL**: Monitor, implement only if regulatory/contractual requirement emerges

---

## COMPENSATING CONTROLS SUMMARY

All identified gaps have documented compensating controls that reduce risk to acceptable levels:

1. **AC-2(13) - No UEBA**: Compensated by MFA, least privilege, quarterly access reviews
2. **AC-6(9) - Manual privileged log review**: Compensated by dual approval for sensitive operations
3. **CM-3(7) - Delayed drift remediation**: Compensated by daily drift detection, restricted console access
4. **IA-5(13) - No PKI auth**: Compensated by FIDO2 hardware keys (equivalent assurance)
5. **RA-3(1) - Informal supplier assessment**: Compensated by vendor security certifications, data minimization
6. **SC-8(5) - No key escrow**: Compensated by Cloud KMS redundancy, multiple key access principals

**Risk Acceptance**: All gaps are assessed as LOW or INFORMATIONAL risk and are acceptable for production operation with current compensating controls until remediation is completed per the POA&M schedule.
